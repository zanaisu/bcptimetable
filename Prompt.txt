I want to create and host a website on Railway.com for my A-level studies, it should be written in python, html, js, css and whatever else you like. The website should manage and track daily study tasks across OCR A Chemistry, OCR A Biology, and AQA Psychology, ensuring a balanced study schedule.

The website should dynamically generate tasks influenced by curriculum.json, allow users to mark tasks as completed or swap them, and adjust topic confidence to influence future task generation. Users should be able to track progress, view past tasks, and plan for upcoming exams.

Core Features

1. User Authentication

1.1 Implement a Register and Login page.
1.2 Users should be able to log in securely and have their data stored in a database.

2. Daily Task System (Home Page)

2.1 Display 2 to 4 tasks per day, ensuring balanced time across all three subjects throughout the week.
2.2 Task Completion:
2.2.1 Users should be able to check off tasks (mark as done) and update topic confidence for the topic of the task.
2.2.2 Users should be able to refresh a task (swap it for another one) and update topic confidence for the swapped-out task.
2.3 Tasks should persist in a database and not reset upon page refresh.
2.4 Users should be able to view previous days' tasks.
2.5 Weekend Mode (Friday-Sunday):
2.5.1 Tasks accumulate to points instead of needing daily completion.
2.5.2 Users can complete them at any time over the weekend.

3. Navigation (Sidebar & UI)

3.1 A collapsible sidebar for navigation.
3.2 Dark mode/light mode toggle.
3.3 Essential pages:
3.3.1 Home (Daily Tasks)
3.3.2 Curriculum (View & adjust topic confidence)
3.3.3 Progress (Statistics & tracking)
3.3.4 Calendar (Task scheduling)
3.3.5 Settings (Customizable study preferences)

4. Curriculum Page

4.1 Display all subjects, topics, and subtopics/topic details from curriculum.json.
4.2 Users can manually adjust topic confidence per topic.
4.3 Topic confidence influences task frequency (lower-confidence topics appear more often).

5. First Login Setup (Settings Page)

5.1 Upon first login, users should be prompted with a full-screen welcome page to set up their study preferences:
5.1.1 Study hours per day (Default: 4 hours) – determines the max task duration per day.
5.1.2 Weekend points goal (Default: 30 points, equivalent to 10 hours of study).
5.1.3 UpLearn Integration (for Chemistry & Biology only):
5.1.3.1 Selecting a subject as "UpLearn-based" means all tasks for that subject will be UpLearn tasks (as opposed to being a mind map or a past paper).
5.1.3.2 The Progress page will include an UpScore tracker for Up Learn-based subjects.
5.1.4 Task type selection - the user should be able to select what types of tasks they receive for each subject, affecting which kinds of tasks can be generated. Some examples may be a mind map or a past paper.
5.1.5 Initial Topic Confidence Setup – users set their confidence levels for each topic.
5.2 This setup page should also be accessible later in the Settings page.

6. Calendar Page

6.1 A compact yet functional calendar showing scheduled tasks for each day.
6.2 A task refresh button next to each task (same functionality as the Home Page refresh).
6.3 Exam Week Navigation:
6.3.1 A button to jump to the weeks of the 2025 A-Level exams:
6.3.1.1 OCR A Biology
6.3.1.2 OCR A Chemistry
6.3.1.3 AQA Psychology
6.3.2 Users should be able to see upcoming exam dates and adjust their study focus accordingly.

7. Progress Page

7.1 Display informative and easy-to-understand infographics about study performance.
7.2 Include:
7.2.1 Task completion history (button to view past tasks).
7.2.2 Weakest topics for each subject based on topic confidence and task completion.
7.2.3 Graphs/Charts to track progress over time.

Additional Considerations

8.1 The website should be very visually appealing, functional, and easy to use.
8.2 Well-formatted, clean, and maintainable code.
8.3 Fully deployable on Railway, with a database for user accounts, tasks, and topic confidence.
